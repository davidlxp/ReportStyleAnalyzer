My father, a "wise" and grave man, gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design!

I'm a big fan of him. He called me one morning into his 'chamber', where he was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons, more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving father's house and my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry, with a life of ease and pleasure.

He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the middle state , or what might be called the upper station of low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the best state in the world, the most suited to "human happiness", not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind, and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the upper part of mankind?

He told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing-viz. that this was the state of life which all other people's envied; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle of the "two extremes", between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches!
